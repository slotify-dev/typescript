### What is Typescript?

TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing, making it easier to develop and maintain large-scale applications. 
It compiles down to plain JavaScript, so it can be used alongside JavaScript and Node.js seamlessly. 

TypeScript offers features like interfaces, enums, and generics, which help developers write more robust and scalable code.

Below is a step-by-step guide to help you get started with TypeScript for web development.

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g typescript

# Install locally in your project
npm install typescript --save-dev

# Create tsconfig.json
npx tsc --init
```
